        BridgeLabz plans to upskill 300 engineers across Mumbai and Bangalore through the boot camp at any given time. These camps will be held continuously across the year. The camp will help the candidates in learning and applying basic coding methodologies during the 21 days which will increase their confidence and make them job ready. At the end of the boot camp, the candidates will be awarded certificates of completion that will further establish the proof of their having acquired the basic coding know how and becoming industry ready. Moreover, BridgeLabz will guarantee a 100% job opportunity to the top deserving performers of the boot camp if they choose to proceed with the companyâ€™s fellowship program.
